## Morning Habits the Make you More Productive

For a long time, I struggled with feeling like my days amounted to something. I would try and fill my day with a bunch of filler things to do like scroll through YouTube, or play Video games that I would later delete and forget. One day, I realized that these things were not making me happy, and the one thing I noticed is that I felt more productive and felt the need for less fillers if I woke up early, and had a routine every morning.

First, make sure you get enough sleep. Second, start your day off with some exercise. Third, stay organized and focused on what needs to get done throughout the day.

Wake up at the same time every day. If you’re not consistent in this area, your productivity will suffer and you’ll likely have trouble getting out of bed on time.

Wake Up Earlier: A better way to start the day is by waking up at least an hour earlier than usual. This gives your body time to naturally wake up, and will give you time to prepare before you have to head out the door.

It's so easy to fall back asleep and sleep in, but if you do that consistently, it will take a toll on your productivity and health.

Keep your room clean and organized, especially if you are working from home and need to stay focused on work.

Get a workout in before you start your day, even if it's just a quick walk around the block or a few squats at home during the morning hours can help you feel energized for the rest of your day!

Eat breakfast every morning, this is because when we eat breakfast we tend to be a lot more productive throughout our day as well as more energetic and focused throughout the day itself!

The morning is a time for starting new things and finishing old ones. The best way to get done what needs to be done on time is to wake up early and start working before everyone else is awake. If you think about it, there are two different ways to take care of yourself in the morning: procrastinating or getting things done.

Procrastinating is not a good thing. It means that you can't handle the pressure of starting your day, so you make it harder on yourself by postponing it. Procrastination makes everything worse because it means that you're putting off doing what needs to be done until later—and then when things are already late, they will be much more difficult or impossible to do at all.

The second way out of procrastination is actually quite simple: prioritize your tasks and stick with them until they're finished. Let's say that your most important task today is finishing an essay for English class tomorrow morning at 9am. That means that if you don't finish it now, then it doesn't matter when or where (or even if) you finish it; whatever happens after 9am tomorrow won't change anything about the essay itself, so there's nothing left to do but finish it. If you want to make sure that you get things done, then prioritize your tasks and stick to them until they're finished.
